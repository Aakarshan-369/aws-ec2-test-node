# Inshorts News Feed | ReactJS, Material, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Render, AWS
## Live at https://inshorts-frontend.onrender.com/ 

- A Infinite Scroll News Feed application, developed utilizing the ReactJS framework and deployed on a
high-performance Render CDN for optimized front-end functionality.
- News Feed is generated by an ExpressJS server, executed on a Node runtime environment, and deployed on an AWS
EC2instance to ensure maximum availability and scalability. The NGINX reverse proxy and PM2 process manager were
implemented to easily handle potential server failures.
- A low latency MongoDB NoSQL document-based database was chosen to store the news feed data, deployed on the
Atlas cloud cluster and accessed via the Mongoose database client.
